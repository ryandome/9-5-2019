<h1> Abilities a software engineer should have </h1>
<ul>
<li> The syllabus talked about how we will be required to work in pairs on the labs. This will help us to work better with others which
is something Mayuko stressed as being very important as a software engineer. You should not expect to be working alone.</li>
<li> Mayuko also discussed how important it is for someone else to view your work once you are done.
This same idea is incorporated into the class through the peer assement which everyone must do. </li>
<li> Mayuko mentioned that being a succesfull software engineer is not all about technichal skills, this is seen in the course objective
for students demostrating visual communication skills. You must have the creativity and vision first to effectively present something
then you use your technical skills to make it happen. </li>
